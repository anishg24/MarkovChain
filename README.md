## Project Objective
I've been meaning to figure out how to create a chat bot for a while (specifically after seeing
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpSWVN4zkg)). 
I decided to dive into the world of automated chat bots by starting with Markov Chains.
Now Markov Chains aren't the way that modern chat bots are created but they are a great start. 
Markov Chains likely run the auto-correct on your phone. It is lightweight and very easy
to learn and implement. This doesn't qualify as deep learning, rather it is simply statistics.

## Methods Used
* Markov Chains 

## Technologies Used
* Python 3.7

## Project Log
I finished this in day, Markov Chains aren't too hard to in Python. I "trained" the model with
[this book](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661), and the text file is included in this repo.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Download any extra `.txt` files from any source. (I used [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/))
3. `python learn.py`
4. `python markov.py`

## Releases
- 1.0.0 (6/5/2020): First working release.
